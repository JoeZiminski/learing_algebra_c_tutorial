Chapter 1: Making a class for matrix storage and operations
    Make a matrix class with data stored as a vector and accessed using (row * n_cols) + col
	Define get / set methods and allow defining class using a number of input formats:
		(random given a size, 1D vector with rows and columns, pass an existing matrix) 
	Overload addition, subtraction, division, multiplication operations for matrix operations
	Note that everything is defined in the .h to use type templates
	Test in the test_code.cpp

Chapter 2: 
	Implement own algorithm for Gauss-Jordan elimination from scratch
	Use Gauss-Jordan elimination to calculate matrix inverse
    personal addition: implement algorithm for calculation of 2x2 and 3x3 determinant
